Description: In this project, Iam going to develop a poker game using JavaScript and
jQuery animation. As for the game, user will place a bet on every hand. First, two cards will be shown to the user,
user can raise the bet (the bet must be between 1 and 10); after user place the bet, the
remaining three cards will be shown to the user and the score will be updated.
Your assignment also needs to determine the logic for various hands including royal flush, four
of a kind, full house, straight, flush, three of a kind, two pairs, one pair and nothing. There is a
reset button to reset the score back to 100.
The webpage “https://api.jquery.com/animate/” is a great resource for the animation.
